# Context rules - customize search behavior based on file patterns.
# When `ra context` analyzes a file, matching rules modify the search:
# - `match`: glob pattern(s) to match file paths (string or array)
# - `trees`: limit search to specific trees (optional)
# - `terms`: additional search terms to inject (optional)
# - `include`: files to always include in results, as "tree:path" (optional)

# [[context.rules]]
# match = "*.rs"
# terms = ["rust"]

# [[context.rules]]
# match = ["*.tsx", "*.jsx"]
# terms = ["typescript", "react"]

# [[context.rules]]
# match = "src/api/**"
# trees = ["docs"]
# terms = ["http", "routing"]
# include = ["docs:api/overview.md"]
