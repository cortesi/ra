# ra configuration file
# See https://github.com/cortesi/ra for documentation

# Define knowledge trees - directories containing documents to index
[trees]
# docs = "./docs"           # Local documentation
# notes = "~/notes"         # Personal notes with tilde expansion

# General settings
[settings]
# default_limit = 5         # Maximum results per query
# local_boost = 1.5         # Relevance multiplier for local trees
# chunk_at_headings = true  # Split documents at h1 boundaries
# max_chunk_size = 50000    # Warning threshold for chunk size (characters)

# Search settings
[search]
# fuzzy = true              # Enable fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
# fuzzy_distance = 1        # Levenshtein distance (0, 1, or 2)
# stemmer = "english"       # Stemming language

# Context command settings
# These control how `ra context` analyzes files to find relevant documentation.
[context]
# limit = 10                # Default chunks to return
# min_term_frequency = 2    # Ignore terms appearing less than this in source
# min_word_length = 4       # Ignore short words in content analysis
# max_word_length = 30      # Ignore very long tokens
# sample_size = 50000       # Max bytes to analyze from large files

# Glob patterns that inject additional search terms when matched.
# When `ra context` analyzes a file, it matches the file path against these
# patterns and adds the corresponding terms to the search query. This helps
# find relevant documentation based on file type or project structure.
#
# Multiple patterns can match the same file - all matching terms are merged.
# Child configs can override patterns from parent configs for the same glob.
#
# [context.patterns]
# # Language-based patterns - match by file extension
# "*.rs" = ["rust"]
# "*.py" = ["python"]
# "*.go" = ["golang"]
# "*.ts" = ["typescript"]
# "*.tsx" = ["typescript", "react"]
# "*.jsx" = ["javascript", "react"]
# "*.rb" = ["ruby"]

# "*.kt" = ["kotlin"]
# "*.java" = ["java"]
# "*.c" = ["c"]
# "*.cpp" = ["cpp"]
# "*.h" = ["c", "cpp"]
# "*.hpp" = ["cpp"]
#
# # Project structure patterns - match by directory
# "src/api/**" = ["http", "handlers", "routing", "REST"]
# "src/auth/**" = ["authentication", "security", "jwt"]
# "src/db/**" = ["database", "queries", "migrations"]

# If no patterns are specified for a tree, all .md and .txt files are included.
