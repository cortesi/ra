# ra configuration file
# See https://github.com/cortesi/ra for documentation

# Define knowledge trees - directories containing documents to index.
# Each tree is a named collection of documents with its own path and patterns.

[tree.docs]
path = "./docs"

# [tree.notes]
# path = "~/notes"
# include = ["**/*.md", "**/*.txt"]

# General settings
# [settings]
# default_limit = 5
# local_boost = 1.5
# chunk_at_headings = true
# max_chunk_size = 50000

# Search settings
# [search]
# stemmer = "english"

# Context command settings
# These control how `ra context` analyzes files to find relevant documentation.
# [context]
# terms = 50               # Max terms in query (higher = more diverse results)
# min_word_length = 4      # Skip tokens shorter than this
# sample_size = 50000      # Bytes to read from large files

# Context rules - customize search behavior based on file patterns.
# When `ra context` analyzes a file, matching rules modify the search:
# - `match`: glob pattern(s) to match file paths (string or array)
# - `trees`: limit search to specific trees (optional)
# - `terms`: additional search terms to inject (optional)
# - `include`: files to always include in results, as "tree:path" (optional)
#
# Multiple rules can match the same file - effects are merged.

# [[context.rules]]
# match = "*.rs"
# terms = ["rust"]

# [[context.rules]]
# match = ["*.tsx", "*.jsx"]
# terms = ["typescript", "react"]

# [[context.rules]]
# match = "src/api/**"
# trees = ["docs"]
# terms = ["http", "routing"]
# include = ["docs:api/overview.md"]
