# Define knowledge trees - directories containing documents to index.
# Each tree is a named collection of documents with its own path and patterns.

# Context command settings
# These control how `ra context` analyzes files to find relevant documentation.

# Glob patterns that inject additional search terms when matched.
# When `ra context` analyzes a file, it matches the file path against these
# patterns and adds the corresponding terms to the search query. This helps
# find relevant documentation based on file type or project structure.
#
# Multiple patterns can match the same file - all matching terms are merged.
# Child configs can override patterns from parent configs for the same glob.
